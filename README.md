Twitter Sentiment Analysis upon the Sentiment140 Dataset from Stanford University.


In order to use this jupyter notebook, you need the original data set from stanford, which can be downloaded at
http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip. Put this folder in the same directory under "twitter-sentiment/"

Furthermore, I have created an environment for this juyter notebook. If you are interested in using it, please
activate it using "source Twitter_ENV/bin/activate".

Please let me know if you face issues with the model. It does take time to run. So in order to speed up
the training, I have reduced the amount of tweets the model is trained on to 100,000.
